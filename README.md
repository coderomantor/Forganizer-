# Forganizer
A file organizer by Roman Ullah.

Forganizer is a quick and easy way to automatically sort a messy folder into categorized directories.

You can separate these files into their respective folders: 
1. `Programming Files`
2. `Image Files`
3. `Video Files`
4. `Document Files`
5. `Audio Files`

## Installation
You no longer need Python installed to use this tool!

1. Open the `Forganizer_Installer` folder.
2. Ensure both `make_key.exe` and `file_organiser.exe` are present.
3. Right-click on **`make_key.exe`** and select **Run as Administrator**.
4. A console will briefly appear confirming that the right-click menu was added successfully.

## Usage
1. Navigate to any messy folder in Windows Explorer.
2. Inside the folder, right-click on empty space to open the context menu.
3. Click on **Forganizer by Roman**.
4. The files will be silently and automatically sorted into folders!

## Recommendations
1. **Never** move, delete, or change the location of the `Forganizer_Installer` folder after installation, otherwise Forganizer will not find the required files.
